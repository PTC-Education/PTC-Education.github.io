Other Publications                                                                                Title/Link                        Details                                                                                                3 Ways AR Can Improve New Technician Skill Adoption                        By 2020, 25% of the American workforce will be approaching retirement. In some industries this is a major concern because these employees will take years of critical expertise into retirement with them. As such, organizations are exploring innovative ways to transfer knowledge from their experienced employees to newer hires.                                                                Magic Quadrant for Industrial IoT Platforms                        Gartner defines the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform market as a set of integrated software capabilities to improve asset management decision making and operational visibility and control for plants, infrastructure and equipment within asset-intensive industries and environments.                                                                MAN Truck &amp;amp; Bus Hits the Fast Lane with ThingWorx Navigate                        MAN Truck was on a digital transformation journey. The manufacturer prides itself on producing individualized products for each of its customers. However, juggling product information through the organization’s various legacy enterprise systems was becoming too complicated to handle given the complex task of customization. What the manufacturer needed was a core PLM “backbone” for its product development – a stable system to manage data with core, foundational functionality – so that the team could continue to develop and manufacture products efficiently.                                                                4 Reasons Remote Monitoring Is Your Best Move to Better Service                        Remote monitoring enables a proactive maintenance approach by providing visibility and insight to equipment performance across the install base.                                                                 Quick Wins and Long-Term Results with Remote Monitoring                        Manufacturing service professionals are problem-solvers, code-breakers and translators. In order to fix a machine that is unexpectedly offline, under-performing, out-of-range or otherwise anomalous, service technicians need to be fluent in the machine’s language. And for industrial equipment, that language is real-time, accurate and accessible data.                                                                How to Improve Operational Performance in Real Time                        Since the very first industrial-strength machine was switched on for the very first time, plant executives have lied awake asking themselves the same questions: How can I predict and prevent machine downtime? How can I tell which small issues will grow into big problems? How can I integrate communication between machines, departments, and people? How can I increase machine safety and compliance?                                                                 ACCELERATING DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION: Improvement Initiatives and Role-Based Industry Apps Take the Lead                        Industry 4.0, Smart Manufacturing, and Digital Transformation all referred to by LNS Research as Industrial Transformation, have be- come the dominant topics of boardroom conversation for large and mid-sized industrial companies alike.                                                                 Quick Start Guide: Monitoring Equipment with IoT                        Manufacturers are making major business improvements using the Internet of Things (IoT). They’re delivering value to customers in new ways and exploring new business models like selling outcomes versus products or shifting to a predictive service model. Some companies are well on their way to this strategic value, while for others it may seem out of reach.                                                                What Is the Business Value of Digital Twin Technology?                        Traditionally a company develops a product, ships it to its customers or through reseller channels and only receives feedback through unreliable customer service portals, surveys or other verbatim mechanisms. What’s lacking in this black-boxed environment are the products actual operational performance and insights.                                                                Accelerating Digitalization in Manufacturing Industries                        Advances in AI, analytics, IoT and 3D printing are transforming the business of manufacturing industries. This research will help CIOs drive the acceleration of new processes, technologies and ecosystems to improve organizational flexibility and agility in an era of digital business.

It works well with Vuforia Expert Capture, as you can guide workers around a 3D model target and deliver first-hand perspective of a procedure in the place around the model where it was carried out.Click this link to see the Vuforia Instruct and Vuforia Expert Capture Help Center for more detailed instructions.Getting Started    Logging In    Start by going to the Vuforia portal. You should see links to a number of different resources related to authoring, using, and analyzing augmented reality experiences. To start creating an experience, click &quot;sign in&quot; next to Vuforia Editor, which should take you to the Vuforia Editor Login Page. If you have been added to an instance of Vuforia Instruct, you should be able to sign in with that email and password.        Creating a First Experience        From the top left you can click &quot;Create&quot; and &quot;New Procedure&quot;. Give the procedure a name and click &quot;Create&quot; (don&#39;t worry about uploading a capture yet).        Uploading a CAD Model        Upload a CAD model by clicking the plus in the top left, select import assets, and 3D. This link contains a list of supported file formats.        Adding CAD to Procedure        To create CAD-based work instructions, you can click &quot;Add 3D to Procedure&quot; at the top and add the CAD model that you&#39;ve just uploaded. Once you import the model, you should see the 3D editor in the middle with the procedure steps on the right.        Add Steps to Procedure        You can add steps to the procedure by clicking the plus on the right. Add a description and any image or video assets (like from Expert Capture) to a step, then you can add a point marker to the CAD model in the 3D editor.        Publish Procedure    Once you are ready, you can publish the experience by clicking &quot;Publish&quot; tab in the top right corner, then clicking the &quot;Publish&quot; button. (NOTE: your user needs to have at least &quot;Manager&quot; permissions to publish an experience)        Manage View Access        Once the experience is published, there is one last step before you can use the experience in the Vuforia Vantage app. From the top right menu, click on your username, then click &quot;Manage published procedures&quot;. Click on the procedure you&#39;ve just published, and from the new menu make sure the proper users have view access.        Viewing Experience    Once you&#39;ve set the view permission, you can download a QR code of the experience from the same panel. On your device (phone, tablet, AR glasses, etc.), open the Vuforia Vantage app and scan the QR code. You should now be able to see your first published procedure    "

          "content": "## Connect Allen-Bradley PLCs to Vuforia Spatial Toolbox with Kepware ### Hardware Needed: ###  - An Allen Bradley PLC (This tutorial was written and tested with two Allen-Bradley PLCs, a [Micro850](https://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/um/2080-um002_-en-e.pdf ) and a [CompactLogix5480](https://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/um/5069-um002_-en-p.pdf).) - An Ethernet Cable   - Windows Computer (This tutorial and testing utilized an Intel NUC)  ## Set up the PLC ### Micro850 Install [Connected Components Workbench (CCW)](https://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductFindDownloads.aspx?crumb=112&amp;refSoft=1&amp;toggleState=&amp;versions=57681), following [these instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU7O8KXfdPA&amp;ab_channel=TimWilborne) from 2:39-8min to configure the PLC with CCW. ### CompactLogix5480For the CompactLogix5480, install Rockwell Automation Studio 5000 Logix Designer. We used [these lessons](https://twcontrols.com/lessons/how-to-connect-to-an-allen-bradley-controllogix-plc-over-ethernet-with-studio-5000-and-rslinx) to connect to and configure our CompactLogix5480.#### Test with a simple programOnce your device is connected anad you can create a program, make a simple &quot;Hello World&quot; that will activate some of outputs on the PLC. A possible demo could be to use the Timer (TON) within CCW to turn your outputs on and off repeatedly. Here&#39;s an example:  - [This video shows the process of using the TON with CCW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI7o78YogGw&amp;ab_channel=InsightsInAutomation). - [This PDF shows the ladder logic](https://github.com/PTC-Academic/DX-Resources/blob/master/Curriculum_Resources/DX-Exercises/Resources/Traffic-Light-Demo-withWalk.pdf) for a traffic light demo made in Studio 5000 Logix Designer.## Set up NetworkingThis project used the ethernet (wired) port to create a local network to communicate to the PLC, and leveraged the wireless network for outbound/internet communications. - For the wireless connection, a static or dynammic IP will work. - For the wired connection, we gave the computer a static ethernet IP Address: 192.168.0.1; Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0; Default Gateway and Primary DNS were set to match the gateway and DNS for the wireless connection.### Set the Micro850 IP addressClick on the `Micro850` tab in CCW and select `Ethernet` on the bottom right. Once selected, scroll down on the right side and select “Configure IP address and settings” underneath **Internet Protocol (IP) Settings**.   - Adjust the IP to your settings. For us, we set the IP Address to 192.168.0.2, the Subnet Mask to 255.255.255.0, and the Gateway Address to 192.168.0.1 ### Set the CompactLogix5480 IP address For the CompactLogix5480, we used RSLinx to set the Ethernet IP Address to 192.168.0.2, the Subnet Mask to 255.255.255.0, and the Gateway Address to 192.168.0.1 per the instructions in the CompactLogix5480 user manual.**To verify that the PLC should is connected to your Windows Computer, [ping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)) the IP address from the command prompt on the computer with ping 192.168.0.2, if the response is some number of ms, they are connected.## Connect the PLC to Kepware - [Download and install KEPServerEX](https://www.kepware.com/en-us/content-gates/ex-demo-download-content-gate/?product=d2239b8c-36f2-4d07-8fbd-e223d0e26bbf&amp;gate=8a5e8dd5-6edf-4d68-aa36-72f97b11e612) -- this is a free trial, but is fully functional; KEPServerEX will run for 2 hours at a time, then it needs to be restarted. Note, this product is also called &quot;ThingWorx Indsutrical Connectivity&quot;.- [Download and install Java](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)Open Kepware, right-click &quot;Connectivity&quot; and add a new Channel:## ![Adding a new Channel on Kepware](/docs/solutions/dxguides/Resources/VST-PLC-image001.png)### Micro850 and CCW[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRFA9YutiUs&amp;ab_channel=LearnWithPro-Tutorial ) walks through the next few steps of the different settings to alter (watch until 9:50min). - **IMPORTANT:** Notice at minute 5:35 how the video says to have the same address for the tag (variable) as in CCW. This address may look something like `_IO_EM_DO_01`. If the tag addresses for all your variables do not match the ones in CCW, the connection with Kepware will not work. To test the connection between your PLC and Kepware: - First, on CCW, connect you PLC and begin to run your &quot;Hello World&quot; program. This can be done by clicking &quot;Disconnect&quot; at the top. If your &quot;Hello World&quot; program does not run in a loop, just click &quot;Disconnect&quot; so that it says &quot;Connected&quot; but do not run the program yet.  - Next, on Kepware click the &quot;Quick Client&quot; button:## ![Quick Client Button&quot;](/docs/solutions/dxguides/Resources/VST-PLC-image002.png) - Once this is clicked, it should open a new window. Select Chanel1.&quot;name of your PLC&quot;, The quality should be labeled as &quot;Good&quot; and once your program on CCW runs (or if it is already running) you should see the value update.## ![Quick Client Panel](/docs/solutions/dxguides/Resources/VST-PLC-image003.png)### CompactLogix5480 and Studio 5000[This Kepware guide](https://www.kepware.com/getattachment/7ce5cce5-7186-4159-88f0-413980a956ae/ab-controllogix-ethernet-easy-guide.pdf) walks through the same steps for Studio 5000. ## Connecting Kepware to Vuforia Spatial Toolbox ### Download the Spatial Toolbox Download and install the spatial toolbox through the [PTC Reality Team’s Website](https://spatialtoolbox.vuforia.com/docs/use/connect-to-the-physical-world/install-on-windows)- After installation, start the toolbox edge server### Connect Kepware and Spatial ToolboxThe Spatial Toolbox uses OPCUA to communicate with Kepware. Once the server is running, follow the steps below to set up Kepware and Spatial Toolbox to work together.#### Configure OPC UA in Kepware - To Add an OPC server in the Kepware configuration, open OPC UA Configuration from the Kepware config tray icon:## ![Kepware config tray icon](/docs/solutions/dxguides/Resources/Kepware-VST-001.png)- Choose the correct adapter (probably wifi, and set a port, or use default. This IP and port will be used in the in the VST edge server Kepware addon configuration.## ![Kepware OPC UA Endpoint Definition](/docs/solutions/dxguides/Resources/Kepware-VST-002.png)- Close window with OK- Create an OPCUA user; open Settings from the Kepware config tray icon:## ![Kepware config tray icon](/docs/solutions/dxguides/Resources/Kepware-VST-003.png)- Create an Admin User with the Kepware (ThingWorx Industrial Connectivity) Settings Control Panel:## ![Kepware (ThingWorx Industrial Connectivity) Settings Control Panel](/docs/solutions/dxguides/Resources/Kepware-VST-004.png)- Save and close#### Configure Vuforia Spatial Toolbox Server settings- Open a browser and navigate to &#39;localhost:8080&#39;- Click on *Manage Hardware Interfaces* and click the *Settings* icon next to Kepware- Enter the *IP:Port*, *username* and *password* in the VST edge server Kepware addon configuration:## ![Spatial Toolbox Hardware Interfaces Kepware Configuration:](/docs/solutions/dxguides/Resources/Kepware-VST-005.png)#### Restart VST Edge server    - In the terminal where you started it, click &#39;CTRL-C&#39; to stop it, and then enter &#39;node server&#39; to start it again- Re-open the OPC UA Configuration from the Kepware config tray icon to Trust the rejected certificate:## ![OPC UA Configuration Manager, Trusted Clients Tab:](/docs/solutions/dxguides/Resources/Kepware-VST-006.png)- Click Close and restart VST Edge Server again, and refresh the server web page#### Reinitialize Kepware- In Kepware, click on the &quot;Runtime&quot; menu (next to &quot;Help&quot;) and select reinitialize. - You should see feedback in the Kepware interface that #### Look for Tags in VST Edge server- Click on *Manage Hardware Interfaces* and click the *Settings* icon next to Kepware- If the connection is working, you should see any tags/varibles you created in your PLC - Check the tags you want to use; now, if you return to *Object Configureation* and add a target to the *kepware....* object, you will have nodes available for each of the tags. #### Have fun!To start playing with the toolbox, please see [this Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBEV5K3dprA&amp;list=PLhL0fv9JyKMaWhaHmm21J6mgpp841zYYw&amp;index=2&amp;ab_channel=CEEOInnovations) to add image targets and how to use the Spatial Toolbox!
